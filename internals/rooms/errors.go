import "errors"

// Sentinel errors for the rooms domain.
//
// Usage pattern (Kennedy's error propagation):
//
//	return fmt.Errorf("rooms.Service.CreateGuestRoom: %w", ErrPlanExceeded)
//
// Handler layer uses errors.Is to map to HTTP status codes:
//
//	ErrRoomNotFound    → 404 Not Found
//	ErrRoomEnded       → 409 Conflict  (room already finished)
//	ErrPlanExceeded    → 403 Forbidden (participant cap reached)
//	ErrSessionExpired  → 410 Gone      (30-min window elapsed)
//	ErrExtendOnce      → 409 Conflict  (guest already used extend)
//
// Sentinel errors must never carry dynamic context in the error value itself —
// that context lives in the wrapping fmt.Errorf message. errors.Is() only
// compares the sentinel identity, not the message.

	// ErrRoomEnded is returned when an operation is attempted on an ended room.
	// Callers should map this to 409 Conflict (the room exists but is closed).
	ErrRoomEnded = errors.New("room has already ended")

	// ErrRoomNotLive is returned when a room is still in 'draft' status and
	// an operation requires it to be 'live' (e.g. generating a viewer token
	// before the host has started the session).
	ErrRoomNotLive = errors.New("room is not live yet")

	// ErrPlanExceeded is returned when the participant count in a room has
	// reached the tier's MaxParticipants cap. Maps to 403 Forbidden.
	ErrPlanExceeded = errors.New("participant limit for this plan has been reached")

	// ErrSessionExpired is returned when the wall-clock time elapsed since
	// room_started exceeds the guest tier session duration (default 30 min).
	// The session enforcer fires this before calling DeleteRoom.
	ErrSessionExpired = errors.New("session duration limit has been reached")

	// once. The extend endpoint is single-use per room per guest tier.

	// ErrInvalidRole is returned when an unrecognised participant role string
	// is passed to token generation.
